=head1 DESCRIPTION

MooseX::Workers is a Role that provides easy delegation of long-running tasks 
into a managed child process. Process managment is taken care of via POE and it's 
POE::Wheel::Run module.

=head1 METHODS

=over 

=item spawn ($command)

=item fork ($command)

=item run_command ($command)

These three methods are the whole point of this module. 
They pass $command through to the MooseX::Worker::Engine which will take 
care of running $command for you.

spawn() and fork() both envoke L<POE::Kernel> call(), which is synchronous.

run_command() envokes L<POE::Kernel> yield(), which is asynchronous.

If max_workers() has been reached, run_command() warns and does nothing. It is up to you to re-submit
$command. See enqueue() if you want us to run $command as soon as another worker is free.

=item enqueue($command)

Just like run_command(), only that if max_workers() has been set and that number of workers
has been reached, then we add $command to a FIFO command queue. As soon as any running 
worker exits, the first $command in queue (if any) will be run.

=item check_worker_threshold

This will check to see how many workers you have compared to the max_workers limit. It returns true
if the $num_workers is >= $max_workers;

=item max_workers($count)

An accessor for the maxium number of workers. This is delegated to the MooseX::Workers::Engine object.

=item has_workers

Check to see if we have *any* workers currently. This is delegated to the MooseX::Workers::Engine object.

=item num_workers

Return the current number of workers. This is delegated to the MooseX::Workers::Engine object.

=item meta

The Metaclass for MooseX::Workers::Engine see Moose's documentation.

=head1 INTERFACE 

MooseX::Worker::Engine supports the following callbacks:

=over

=item worker_manager_start

Called when the managing session is started

=item worker_manager_stop

Called when the managing session stops

=item max_workers_reached

Called when we reach the maximum number of workers

=item worker_stdout

Called when a child prints to STDOUT

=item worker_stderr

Called when a child prints to STDERR

=item worker_error

Called when there is an error condition detected with the child.

=item worker_done

Called when a worker completes $command

=item worker_started

Called when a worker starts $command

=item sig_child

Called when the mangaging session recieves a SIG CHDL event

=item sig_*

Called when the underlying POE Kernel receives a signal; this is not limited to
OS signals (ie. what you'd usually handle in Perl's %SIG) so will also accept
arbitrary POE signals (sent via POE::Kernel->signal), but does exclude
SIGCHLD/SIGCHILD, which is instead handled by sig_child above.

These interface methods are automatically inserted when MooseX::Worker::Engine
detects that your manager class contains any methods beginning with sig_.
Signals are case-sensitive, so if you wish to handle a TERM signal, you must
define a sig_TERM() method.  Note also that this action is performed upon
MooseX::Worker::Engine startup, so any run-time modification of your class
which 'does' MooseX::Workers is not likely to be detected.

See the sig_TERM handler in the SYNOPSIS for an example.

See L<MooseX::Workers::Engine> for more details. 
Also see L<MooseX::Workers::Job> if you'd like to give your tasks
names, or set timeouts on them.
